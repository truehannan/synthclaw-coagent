# SynthClaw-CoAgent

**Your personal AI agent that lives on a cheap VPS and talks to you through Telegram or WhatsApp.**

SynthClaw-CoAgent is a lightweight, self-hosted AI agent that runs on a single server. It can execute shell commands, manage files, call APIs, run background services, store encrypted credentials, and remember things across conversations — all controlled through natural chat.

---

## Why SynthClaw?

There are big agent frameworks out there (see [comparison below](#synthclaw-vs-zeroclaw)). SynthClaw isn't trying to compete with them. It fills a different gap:

- **You want a personal AI assistant**, not an enterprise platform
- **You want it running in 5 minutes**, not after configuring 47 TOML files
- **You want it on a $6/month VPS**, not a Kubernetes cluster
- **You want to chat with it on Telegram/WhatsApp**, not through a CLI or web UI
- **You want to read and understand the entire codebase** in one sitting (~800 lines of Python)

---

## Features

- **Conversational AI** — Not just a task executor. It chats, explains, has opinions, and knows when to use tools vs just talk.
- **12 Built-in Tools** — Shell commands, file I/O, HTTP requests, systemd services, encrypted credential storage, persistent memory
- **Telegram + WhatsApp** — Full bot interfaces for both platforms
- **Any LLM Backend** — Works with any OpenAI-compatible API (DigitalOcean Gradient AI, OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, etc.)
- **Multi-Model** — Switch between models on the fly with `/model`
- **Encrypted Credentials** — Fernet encryption for stored API keys and passwords
- **Persistent Memory** — Key-value store that survives across conversations
- **Planning Mode** — `/plan` breaks tasks into steps without executing
- **Agent Mode** — `/agent` executes tasks autonomously, chaining tools without confirmation
- **Owner Lock** — First user to `/start` becomes the owner; everyone else is blocked
- **Interactive Setup** — CLI wizard generates your `.env` configuration

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truehannan/synthclaw-coagent.git
cd synthclaw-coagent
```

### 2. Configure

**Option A — Interactive wizard (recommended):**
```bash
python3 setup_cli.py
```

**Option B — Manual:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Fill in your tokens
```

### 3. Deploy to Server

```bash
# Copy files to your VPS
scp -r ./* root@your-server:/opt/agent/

# SSH in and run setup
ssh root@your-server 'bash /opt/agent/setup_server.sh'

# Start the agent
ssh root@your-server 'systemctl start agent'
```

### 4. Chat

Open Telegram, find your bot, send `/start`. That's it.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Register as owner (first user only) |
| `/help` | Show all commands |
| `/clear` | Wipe conversation history |
| `/model [name]` | Show or switch LLM model |
| `/models` | List available models |
| `/status` | Show running systemd services |
| `/creds` | List stored credentials (values hidden) |
| `/memory` | Show all remembered facts |
| `/run <cmd>` | Execute a shell command directly |
| `/plan <task>` | Break a task into steps (no execution) |
| `/agent <task>` | Autonomous mode — executes without asking |
| `/ping` | Check if the agent is alive |

**Or just chat normally:**
> "What's the best way to set up a cron job?"
>
> "Create a Python script that checks Bitcoin price every hour and logs it"
>
> "Remember my timezone is UTC+5"

**Files:**

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `main.py` | Entry point — launches Telegram, WhatsApp, or both | ~40 |
| `agent.py` | Telegram bot + LLM agent loop | ~300 |
| `whatsapp_bot.py` | WhatsApp webhook server (Flask) | ~280 |
| `tools.py` | 12 tool implementations | ~230 |
| `memory.py` | SQLite + Fernet encryption layer | ~170 |
| `config.py` | Environment-based configuration | ~45 |
| `setup_cli.py` | Interactive setup wizard | ~180 |
| `setup_server.sh` | VPS bootstrap script | ~50 |

**Total: ~1300 lines.** You can read and understand the entire thing.

## WhatsApp Setup

WhatsApp uses the [Meta Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started) with webhooks (unlike Telegram's polling).

### Steps:

1. Create a [Meta Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Create an app → Add WhatsApp product
3. Get your **Access Token** and **Phone Number ID** from the WhatsApp dashboard
4. Run `python setup_cli.py` and choose "whatsapp" or "both"
5. Deploy to your server
6. Set up your webhook URL in Meta dashboard:
   - URL: `https://your-domain:8443/webhook`
   - Verify token: the one from your `.env`
   - Subscribe to `messages`

> **Note:** You need HTTPS for webhooks. Use nginx + Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare Tunnel.

## LLM Providers

SynthClaw works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Set `OPENAI_API_BASE` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`.

| Provider | API Base | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| DigitalOcean Gradient AI | `https://inference.do-ai.run/v1` | Default. Llama 3.3, Mistral, DeepSeek |
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | GPT-4o, GPT-4-mini |
| Ollama (local) | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | Free, runs on your own hardware |
| Together AI | `https://api.together.xyz/v1` | Llama, Mixtral, many open models |
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | Fast inference |
| Any vLLM server | `http://your-server:8000/v1` | Self-hosted |

## SynthClaw vs ZeroClaw

[ZeroClaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) (formerly OpenClaw) is a massive open-source AI agent infrastructure project — 26K+ stars, 137 contributors, written in Rust. It's impressive engineering. But it solves a different problem.

| | **SynthClaw-CoAgent** | **ZeroClaw** |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Personal assistant for one person | Enterprise agent infrastructure |
| **Language** | Python (~1300 lines) | Rust (~100K+ lines) |
| **Setup time** | 5 minutes | Complex (Rust toolchain, TOML configs, binary compilation) |
| **Server requirements** | $6/mo VPS (1 vCPU, 512MB RAM) | Significant resources |
| **Channels** | Telegram + WhatsApp | 17+ (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, Signal, etc.) |
| **Architecture** | Single process, simple loop | Gateway/daemon, trait-driven, plugin system |
| **LLM integration** | Any OpenAI-compatible API | Custom provider traits, multiple backends |
| **Configuration** | `.env` file + CLI wizard | TOML files, identity system (AIEOS) |
| **Security model** | Owner lock + Fernet encryption | Sandboxing, pairing, allowlists, audit trails |
| **Memory** | SQLite + key-value store | Multiple backends (Redis, Postgres, etc.) |
| **License** | Source Available (non-commercial) | MIT + Apache-2.0 |
| **Who it's for** | Solo developers, personal use | Teams, orgs, production deployments |

**TL;DR:** ZeroClaw is a framework for building agent systems. SynthClaw is a ready-to-use personal agent you deploy in 5 minutes and chat with from your phone.
