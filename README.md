**Your personal AI agent that lives on a cheap VPS and talks to you through Telegram or WhatsApp.**

SynthClaw-CoAgent is a lightweight, self-hosted AI agent that runs on a single server. It can execute shell commands, manage files, call APIs, run background services, store encrypted credentials, and remember things across conversations — all controlled through natural chat **or the CLI**.

---

## 🎯 Why SynthClaw?

- 👤 **You want a personal AI assistant**, not an enterprise platform
- ⚡ **You want it running in 5 minutes**, not after configuring 47 TOML files
- 💰 **You want it on a $6/month VPS**, not a Kubernetes cluster
- 📱 **You want to chat with it on Telegram/WhatsApp**, not through a web UI
- 🖥️ **You want full CLI control** — setup, deploy, manage, all with one command
- 📖 **You want to read and understand the entire codebase** in one sitting (~1300 lines of Python)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (CLI Wizard)

### 1. Clone & Install CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truehannan/synthclaw-coagent.git
cd synthclaw-coagent/cli
npm install && npm run build
npm link
```

After `npm link`, the `synthclaw` command is available globally on your machine.

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
synthclaw setup
```

The wizard interactively asks for everything:
- Interface mode (Telegram / WhatsApp / Both)
- Telegram bot token
- WhatsApp API credentials (if applicable)
- LLM provider API key & base URL
- Default model selection
- Server settings (remote host, base directory)

No more manually editing `.env` files. One command handles it all.

### 3. Deploy to Your VPS

```bash
synthclaw deploy
```

This uploads all agent files, writes your `.env`, installs Python dependencies, sets up the systemd service, and starts the agent — all in one step.

### 4. Start Chatting

Open Telegram, find your bot, send `/start`. That's it.

Or use the CLI directly:

```bash
synthclaw agent "deploy a node server on port 3000"
synthclaw run "systemctl status nginx"
synthclaw plan "set up daily backups for /var/www"
```

## 💬 WhatsApp Setup

WhatsApp uses the [Meta Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started) with webhooks.

The `synthclaw setup` wizard handles all WhatsApp configuration. You just need:

1. A [Meta Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. An app with WhatsApp product added
3. Your **Access Token** and **Phone Number ID** from the WhatsApp dashboard

Then run:
```bash
synthclaw setup   # choose "whatsapp" or "both"
synthclaw deploy  # deploys everything to your VPS
```

Set up your webhook URL in Meta dashboard:
- URL: `https://your-domain:8443/webhook`
- Verify token: shown after setup
- Subscribe to `messages`

> **Note:** You need HTTPS for webhooks. Use nginx + Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare Tunnel.

## 🧠 LLM Providers

SynthClaw works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Configure via `synthclaw setup` or `synthclaw model`.

| Provider | API Base | Notes |
